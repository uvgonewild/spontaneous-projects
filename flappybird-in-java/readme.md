# Flappy Bird
This project focused on replicating the old and gold ```Flappy Bird``` but with a simple twist. The game has two dimensions ( two entites ) which you can control, but they ```both react oppositely``` to your controls.

 - built on : ```Java```
 - time : ```Aug 4, 2023```
 - competiton duration : ```2 Hours```

## Result?
The Project didn't build at the spot, the computers had the ```older version``` of java, my project broke and recieved a ```participation certificate```
